</p>
<p>
As the helpdesk agent once you are signed into your portal and you got to your tickets section this is where you will all your active tickets

</p>
<p>
Once you open the ticket as a helpdesk agent your job is to take note of the information of the ticket like the problem itself and consider the priority level, SLA, who's best suited for the solution department wise, if not you, the topic it was filed under and make adjustments accordingly.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
After taking in the considerations you update the ticket by assigning it to the right department, elevating the SLA, and fixing the topic to appropriately reflect the subject matter
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now as the help desk agent that is assigned to the ticket you can now make comments and updates and talk to the client directly. after which if the ticket is becomes resolved you can update the status to closed.
